            Hey! Good to see you here, my name is Crystal *waves* Iâ€™m 24 for now, and I love all things creative. I am
            going to be a front end developer, as creative things have always inspired me.
            As both a female and member of the LGBTIQA+ community I have always found myself looking out for the
            underdog. Tech had always drawn me in from a young age (it has nothing to do with being a millennial ðŸ˜‰)
            I was always intrigued by video games, the way things were put together such as toasters. Therefore, tech
            was always something that was drawn to me and so it made sense to divulge into the IT industry.
