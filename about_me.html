        <p> Hey! Good to see you here, my name is Crystal ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m 24 for now, and I love all things creative. <br>
            I am going to be a front end developer! isnt that great? I am currently studying. <br>
            front end atrracts be as creative things have always had a big influence in my life and passions <br>
            As both a female and member of the LGBTIQA+ community I have always found myself looking out for the
            underdog. <br>
            Tech had always drawn me in from a young age (it has nothing to do with being a millennial ðŸ˜‰) <br>
            I was always intrigued by video games, the way things were put together such as toasters. <br>
            Therefore tech was always something that was drawn to me and so it made sense to divulge into the IT
            industry.<br>

                <p>
                    One of the most important things for me whether it be in work or everyday life is the ability to be
                    myself. <br>
                    clichÃ© or not, but you only live once, and to hide my personality from the world is not something I
                    wish to do. <br>

                    <h5> A piece of my writing</h5>

                    "We always take the little things for granted and then the bigger things seem impossible, to live
                    in the shadows, is to
                    live without light and Iâ€™m afraid of the dark, so let me shine"
