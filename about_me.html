                    Hey! Good to see you here, my name is Crystal ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m 24 for now, and I love all things creative.
                    I am going to be a front end developer, as creative things have always inspired me. As both a
                    female
                    and member of the LGBTIQA+ community I have always found myself looking out for the underdog.
                    Tech had always drawn me in from a young age (it has nothing to do with being a millennial ðŸ˜‰)
                    I was always intrigued by video games, the way things were put together such as toasters.
                    Therefore,
                    tech was always something that was drawn to me and so it made sense to divulge into the IT
                    industry.
    </p>
    <P> </P>
